# AssemblyDev
- Author: @artis24106 / @twinklestar03
    - Shoutout to @artis24106 for the codebase!
    - I only add remote functionality to this project.

- Structure:
```
/build :  required for `make`
/local-scripts : checker can run at local, same as remote
/example.asm : just a assembly
```
- How to?
    - `make` to assemble assembly
    - Use `/local-scripts` for testing
- Submit to remote server
    - Check service location at EDU-CTF Platform
    - Base64 encode **your assembly code**, not assembled binaries
